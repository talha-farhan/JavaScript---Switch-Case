    <h4>Things to Know</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the switch statement, we compare the condition value with multiple cases.</li>
            <li>When there is a match with any one of the cases, the block of code corresponding with that case is executed.</li>
            <li>Each case has a name or a number, which is known as its identifier.</li>
            <li>The switch case is different from the if else if statement</li>
            <li>This is how it works:
                <ol>
                    <li>The switch expression is evaluated once.</li>
                    <li>The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.</li>
                    <li>If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.</li>
                    <li>If there is no match, the default code block is executed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <p>
        switch(expression) {
            case 1:
              // code block
              break;
            case 2:
              // code block
              break;
            default:
              // code block
          }
    </p>
